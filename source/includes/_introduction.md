# Introduction

**Welcome, Squarelink Developer!**

Squarelink is the first access tool for blockchain apps and services that enables users to securely recover lost private keys.
We'll walk you through integrating Squarelink into your app or DApp so your users can seamlessly interact with the blockchain.

We offer standard OAuth 2.0 "Sign In" integrations along with a REST API for interacting with Squarelink user accounts as well as "Sign Tx" integrations to easily request transactions from a user.

<aside class="warning">BETA DISCLAIMER</aside>

Squarelink and the Squarelink API are currently in beta. We will periodically add features, but we don't anticipate any breaking changes to our API. In the event breaking changes are introduced, Squarelink Developers will be notified via email in advance of the change.

Squarelink is a community tool currently offered for free, without warranty.

If you'd like to request features or contribute to the community, please see [Community](#community) 

For any API-related issues or custom needs, please email [support@squarelink.com](mailto:support@squarelink.com)

## Getting Started

Before integrating either Sign In or Sign Tx, you must first create an account in the [Squarelink Developer Console](https://dev.squarelink.com) and register your application.

Once you register your first application, you'll receive a `client_id` and `client_secret`. Your `client_id` is a public value used to identify your application, but remember to keep your `client_secret` hidden - never insert it into a public application.
