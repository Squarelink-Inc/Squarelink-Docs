### Welcome, Squarelink Developer!

Squarelink is the long awaited, non-custodial, alternative to MetaMask that enables users to interact with ÐApps from **any device or browser** with **just an email and password**.

We'll walk you through integrating Squarelink into your app or ÐApp so your users can easily interact with the blockchain.

For this, you can quickly install our Web3 Provider and use Web3.js as you normally would!

We also offer the OAuth-style **"Sign Tx"** tool that allows you to easily request transactions from a user without requiring Web3 capabilities in your app. Along with it, we provide a standard OAuth 2.0 **"Sign In"** integrations along with a REST API for interacting with Squarelink user accounts.

## Getting Started

To start integrating either **Sign Tx** or **Sign In**, let's first create an account in our [Developer Console](https://dev.squarelink.com) and register your ÐApp.
