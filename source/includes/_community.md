# Community

Squarelink's Developer tools are community-driven projects for blockchain developers. We are currently in Beta and have not yet open-sourced any core technology. However, we would like to give Squarelink users and developers the opportunity to drive the direction of the project.

In order to request feature modifications or additions, you can either email [support@squarelink.com](mailto://support@squarelink.com) *OR* you may submit a pull-request on Squarelink's Improvement Proposals repository [here](https://github.com/Squarelink-Inc/SIPs). Please read the instructions in the README before submitting a pull request.
